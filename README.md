# surfdome

This project was built for a technical test set by Surfdome in August 2016.

It was completed in about an hour (for actual coding) and a half (for noodling about with fonts and colours).

The present version is fixed width, but the structure should allow for the template to be made responsive fairly easily in the future. The markup was also designed to be easy to implement in a CMS, with, for example, the size of the main tiles being set through CSS classes that would be simple to specify and expand upon.

The page was tested on Mac only, in Safari, Firefox and Chrome.
